DEVELOPMENT NOTES

2) SOME WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE NO ACCIDENTALLY CLICKING DURING THE GAME THAT WILL DISRUPT GAME FLOW.
3) IN FUTURE, WOULD ADD FUNCTIONALITY TO ENTER PLAYER NAMES AND MAYBE STORE SCORES IN A DATABASE.
4) WILL ALSO NEED MORE QUESTIONS OR POTENTIALLY THE ABILITY TO SELECT AMONGST TOPICS FOR REPLAYABILITY.
